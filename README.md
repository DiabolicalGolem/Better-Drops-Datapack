# ![pack.png](https://github.com/DiabolicalGolem/Better-Drops-Datapack/blob/main/pack.png) Better Drops (Datapack)

*Adding drops to the dropless.*

## About

This is the supplementary datapack to the "[Better Drops (Resource Pack)](https://github.com/DiabolicalGolem/Better-Drops-Resource-Pack/blob/main/README.md)" that allows it to interface with the game.

As of right now, this datapack only changes the loot tables of the mobs in question and does not provide any additional functionality (i.e. the mobs drop retextured sticks that you cannot eat). It may be possible in the future that everything the author desires can be accomplished with this datapack, but that is not the case at the moment.

## Installing

To install this datapack, just follow the tutorial [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Installing_a_data_pack). It should sort out the rest.
